This file tries to take aspects of the Bayesian workflow paper by Gelman and 
colleagues and apply them to an example scenario in experimental psychology / cognitive neuroscience.

The workflow paper can be found here: http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808

The workflow is broken down into several different stages. Each stage has its
own markdown file. I found it easier to organise things in this way such that each script represents a little self-contained module or sub-processe. 

One important caveat. This is not an exhaustive or complete application of the 
Bayesian workflow. It is simply a selection of total set of processes that are 
then applied to an example. I've found it useful to think about in this way and 
so I wanted to write it down. There is much more richness and subtlety in the
article than I have tried to convey in these scripts. There is also an important
iterative dimension that I don't really talk about here. The iterative part is important though because Gelaman and co. talk about cycling through different stages and knowledge and understanding develops. See Figure 1 in the above paper for a visualisation of the non-serial and iterative nature of the workflow.

Anyway, it's a really good paper, and I didn't want to spoil all the fun for you.
So just go and read it.
